# Specification Quality Checklist: Todo CLI App (Phase 1)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-04
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Summary**: All checklist items passed successfully on first review.

**Specification Quality**: The specification is complete, clear, and ready for the planning phase (`/sp.plan`).

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization of user stories (P1-P4) with independent testability
- Comprehensive functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-018) covering all CRUD operations
- Well-defined success criteria that are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Properly scoped with clear boundaries between Phase 1 and future phases
- No clarification markers - all requirements are unambiguous
- Edge cases identified for robust implementation planning

**Validation Date**: 2026-01-04
**Status**: ✅ PASSED - Ready for `/sp.plan`
